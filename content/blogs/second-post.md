## Powerful Features

Next.js offers several rendering strategies:

*   **Static Site Generation (SSG):** Pre-renders pages at build time. Great for performance.
*   **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):** Renders pages on each request.
*   **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR):** Updates static pages after deployment without a full rebuild.

This blog will leverage SSG/ISR for optimal performance.

```javascript
// Example: Fetching data in Next.js
export async function getStaticProps() {
  // Fetch data from API or filesystem
  return { props: { data } };
}
```
