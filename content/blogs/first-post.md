## Why Tailwind?

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework packed with classes like `flex`, `pt-4`, `text-center` and `rotate-90` that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup.

It allows for rapid UI development without writing custom CSS. Combined with Next.js, it provides a fantastic developer experience.
