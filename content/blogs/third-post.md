## The Simplicity of Markdown

Markdown allows writers to focus on content rather than complex formatting tools. Its plain text nature makes it highly portable and version-control friendly.

### Key Features

1.  **Readability:** Easy to read even in its raw form.
2.  **Simplicity:** Minimal syntax to learn.
3.  **Flexibility:** Converts easily to HTML.

This approach fits well with static site generators like Next.js.
